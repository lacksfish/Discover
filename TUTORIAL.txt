Step 1 - Using GTK-based tool via MSYS2

- Download MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/

- Open an MSYS2 shell (Windows Key -> MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit)

- Run:
   pacman -Suy

- Run: 
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-glade mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pillow mingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2 mingw-w64-x86_64-python-gobject mingw-w64-x86_64-glib2 mingw-w64-x86_64-python-numpy mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip
(Test if GTK is working by executing: gtk3-demo)

- Install git:
   pacman -S git


Step 2 - Run the Overlay

- Clone the Overlay Project:
   git clone https://github.com/lacksfish/Discover-Windows-Overlay.git

- Install Python requirements:
   cd Discover-Windows-Overlay
   python3 -m pip install .

- Update Start Script
Go to the Discover folder under "C:\msys64\home\YOURUSERNAME\Discover-Windows-Overlay"
Edit the file startWin.sh

- Create a shortcut
On your Desktop, make a new Shortcut (right-click, New, Shortcut)
Enter this for the path - make sure to replace YOURUSERNAME with your username:
C:\msys64\usr\bin\mintty.exe /bin/env MSYSTEM=MINGW64 /bin/bash -l /c/msys64/home/YOURUSERNAME/Discover-Windows-Overlay/startWin.sh

- Test the Overlay
Enter an empty voice channel and check if the Overlay is working


Step 3 - OBS setup (with Overlay running)

- Add a Window Capture
Select the "Discover Voice" window
Capture method has to be "Windows Graphics Capture"
You can check "Capture Cursor"

- Add Filter to Window Capture
Add a "Color Key" filter, set Key Color to #000000 (black) and set Similarity and Smoothness to 1

- Customize Overlay to your preferences
Right click the overlay icon in the status bar (next to your clock in the Windows bar) and select settings
