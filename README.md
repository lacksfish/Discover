# Discover Windows Overlay
Yet another Discord overlay for ~~Linux~~ Windows written in Python using GTK3.

Original version by developer trigg, modded for Among Us on Windows.

Considerably lighter on system resources and less hack-and-slash included than discord-overlay.

## Whats so special about this version ?

This version will hide lobby codes of Among Us lobbies from Discord usernames.

For example these usernames:

```
SussDude - ACBFED - NA
SussDude | ACBFED
SussDude ACBFED NA
ACBFED SussDude
```

Will all be displayed as `SussDude`

Oh, and it runs on Windows
